## What?

Access logs have been generated for user `{{@username}}` in separate geographic locations in a window of time in which travel between them would have been impossible.

User: `{{@username}}`
First location: `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}`, `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}}`
Second Location: `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}}`

## Why?

Impossible travel is monitored to detect shared or compromised credentials, both of which indicate a security concern on the platform.

## What's next?
1. Contact `{{@username}}` to understand if this alert was generated by actions they have taken.
2.
a). If this was not the user, rotate credentials and lock-down theaccount immediately
b). If this was the user and they have shared credentials with a colleague, they should be reminded of any corporate policies about credential sharing.
c). If this was the user and they were completing some BAU activity, the monitor should be reviewed / exceptions added.
3. If this was a malicious compromise of a user's account, and audit should be undertaken to determine if any malicious activity taken.
